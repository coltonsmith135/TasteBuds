# __Overview 📁__

## User Story

```md

AS AN avid foodie, but also a recluse, 
I WANT a website that will list people who need more people for a food reservation, 
SO THAT that I can eat good food with fun people and not alone.

```

## Project Requirements

```md
- Use React for the front end.
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Include authentication (JWT).
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).
- Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
